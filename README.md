# CS303-Rhythm-Game
This was my final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, I created a rhythm game, similar to the popular game "Dance Dance Revolution" with a partner.

To run the code, contain all files in the same folder (working directory)
-Compile the code using your IDE
-Go to the RhythmGame.java file and run the program.
